# juicebox

ABOUT: First major Backend-project I have worked on. Juicebox is a simpler Tumblr clone but was not very simple to implement. We first designed the back-end database layer with specific endpoints (or routes) that we eventually wired up to a web server with a custom API. Used custom curl commands to check progress along the way. 

PROS: Was able to test my backend knowledge and learned a lot about node.js, express, and PostgreSQL. I have previous experience with Microsoft SQL from undergrad so writing the queries for Postgres was much less intimidating than I had first thought it would be. Happy that I was able to wire up routes/endpoints as well because API work is probably one of my weak points so the more practice the better. 

CONS: Not a con but more of a humbling realization, is that the more I learn the more I realize how much I don't know. This was great practice for me, but I understand I have a long ways to go still. Which is in my opinion, very exciting and one of the reasons I am so interested in the programming space. I'm always learning and do not think I will ever become bored/stagnant due to the abundance of information out there. Relative to this project I'd say I still need more work when it comes to API routes and making appropriate writing appropriate calls for various routes. Also need to become more comfortable with JSWON tokens and authentication/authorization.
